amyloid train on:
mouse 18 _ slice b1
mouse 25 f slice b1
mouse 27 f slice b2
mouse 30 f slice b2

the classifier does not generalize well on images with low amyloid (thinks high background are plaques) -- m29, m31


microglia train on:
mouse 18 _ slice b1
mouse 25 f slice b1
mouse 29 m slice b1
mouse 30 f slice b2

redo with lower min. plaque size (500 um^3?)

-----------------------

5_f_b1 has a huge gap in microglia, staining artifact? hpc roi selection might not be accurate
5_f_b2 has a huge cluster of amyloid in the bottom left corner
7_m_b1 has d54d2 staining along dentate gyrus


amyloid train on:
mouse 1f slice b1
mouse 3m slice b2
mouse 11m slice b1
mouse 14m slice b1


biggest variability in counting plaques comes from volume filter. 
min. amyloid plaque size for all classifiers. -- for now, (4/3)*pi*(8^3)~=2000 um^3
 - TODO: if this value is good, go back and modify 18-32 classifier, recollect data

redo with lower min. plaque size (500 um^3?)



microglia train on:
mouse 1f slice b1
mouse 4m slice b1
mouse 10f slice b2
mouse 13m slice b2


min. microglia size for all classifiers. -- for now, 0 um^3


-----------------------


40_f_b1 has a dim circular region in bottom right of hpc

min amyloid size -- for now, 500 um^3

amyloid train on:
mouse 33m slice b1
mouse 36m slice b2
mouse 40f slice b1

amyloid classifier does not seem to do great with the high background stuff.

microglia train on:
mouse 33m slice b2
mouse 37f slice b1
mouse 40f slice b1
